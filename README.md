### Reflection

This a test project built in my free time after work hours and in the weekend.
It took me a while to translate the Japanese text, it helps me to understand purpose of this web app to have the basic idea of the workflow.
After that, I started to build up the structure and look for some third party library that needed, created website main layout, setup environment/global variables, prepare resources. When having the main layout, I started going to the detail, divide each screen to smaller component.
